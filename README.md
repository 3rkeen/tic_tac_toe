# Tic Tac Toe game 

> In this project, we're going to build a [Tic Tac Toe game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe). The main goal is to put into practice the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming. Particularly, classes and access to their attributes.


## Built With

- Ruby 2.6

## Getting start

In order to start with the project:

1. You need to have ruby environment installed. [Click here for instructions](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
2. Clone [this repository :blue_book:](https://github.com/Bekhzod96/tic_tac_toe.git)
3. Run the algorithm file
    - In a terminal window write `ruby `*`[your_file_path]`*`bin/main.rb`

## Instructions

RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

## How to start the game

> After running the `main.rb` the file you will be able to see this console information.

1.  Write each one a nickname
2.  The first player will select the sign `X` or `O`
3.  The first player gives a move, then the second player does same until there's a winner or a draw

## Testing

> We are using [RSpec testing tool](https://rspec.info/) to test all enumerable methods. Also some detailed [documentation](https://relishapp.com/rspec/docs) about this tool

### Install
- In a terminal window type `gem install rspec`
- Once rspec install has finished, type `rspec --init`
- You will see a folder `spec` and a file `.rspec`
- Inside `spec` folder you'll see a `spec_helper.rb` file.

### Run
> We have already created a file called `main_spec.rb`, if you want to create another one with the end *`[your file name]`*`_spec.rb`
- Open `./spec/main_spec.rb` file
- Open a terminal window and type `rspec`
- If all test were passed you will see:

Else you'll see a red message, then check errors and fix them
